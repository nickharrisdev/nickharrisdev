### Howdy pardner ðŸ¤ 

Iâ€™m a self-taught web developer with a diverse professional background currently on the [Rheaply](https://rheaply.com) product team. I create UIs that are beautiful, accessible, intuitive, and performant for users, while also reusable, extensible, and maintainable for other developers.

Iâ€™m inspired by technology that actively strives to make the world a better place. In addition, I volunteer my expertise regularly to help non profit organizations with missions that move me.

### Howdy pardner ðŸ¤ 

I'm a product-minded software engineer who believes the most important part of software is the people â€” both those who build it and those who use it. I see software as a medium for communicating intentions, reflecting human relationships, and solving real-world problems with empathy and purpose. Technology excites me most when it's used effectively to meet meaningful needs and bring people closer together.

Specializing in front-end development, I create user interfaces that are beautiful, accessible, intuitive, and performant for users and reusable, extensible, and maintainable for developers. I care deeply about building thoughtful tools that last, empower, and inspire.

### Howdy pardner ðŸ¤ 

Iâ€™m a Senior Software Engineer with a diverse professional background currently on the [Rheaply](https://rheaply.com) product and engineering team. I craft UIs that are beautiful, accessible, and performant for users while ensuring they are reusable, extensible, and maintainable for engineering teams.

Beyond building great software, I'm passionate about mentoring, improving developer experience, and contributing to technology that makes a meaningful impact. I also volunteer my expertise to support nonprofit organizations whose missions inspire me.
